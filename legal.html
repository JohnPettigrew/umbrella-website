    <h2>The legal stuff</h2>

    <p>These plain-English terms and conditions explain how Umbrella Analytics operates, the expectations that you should have of us, and the responsibilities that we ask you to bear. There is, of course, a <a href="{{ site.url }}/terms.html">full set of T&Cs</a> in proper legal language that you should review but this page is intended to set out the major points clearly so that users (and potential users) know how we relate to our users. We also have a separate <a href="{{ site.url }}/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}/cookie.html">Cookie Policy</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/request-for-data.html">Data-Request Policy</a> that you should review, as well as a list of the <a href="{{ site.url }}/thirdparty.html">third-party software</a> that we use as part of Umbrella Analytics.</p>

    <h3>1. Who are we?</h3>

    <p>Umbrella Analytics is a product of Umbrella Analytics Ltd, a company whose registered office is 50 Crown Street, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk IP33 1QX, UK and with company registration number 11323851.</p>

    <h3>2. Payment</h3>

    <p>This is often the most crucial issue in users' minds, we know. Most people may use Umbrella Analytics for free to review their organisationâ€™s data and collaborate without restriction. If, however, you want to upload data to our site, you need to have a paid account.</p>

    <p>We calculate our fees based on the size of your organisation. How this is defined varies depending on your particular products but is always related to your number of employees. Our payment plans are advertised on our website, and may change from time to time. If we do change our plans, we will let existing customers know within 7 days and they will then have 60 days to decide which new plan to adopt (or to terminate their use of Umbrella Analytics). New customers will be charged the new rates immediately.</p>

    <p>Subscriptions run monthly or annually. If you end your subscription and restart within 3 months, we will treat this as a continuous subscription and charge for the intervening months when you resubscribe. We invoice monthly in pounds sterling, and if you pay in a currency other than sterling, we may charge extra fees. We may also charge administration fees if you pay via certain channels.</p>

    <p>Invoices are payable within 30 days and late payments may result in your losing access to the service and/or additional charges. You must provide complete, accurate and up-to-date payment information for your Publisher account in order to retain access.</p>

    <p>If you believe that we have made a mistake on an invoice, let us know within 30 days and we will check our records and get back to you within 14 days. We will remedy any mistakes promptly.</p>

    <h3>3. Access to the service</h3>

    <p>By using Umbrella Analytics, you indicate that you accept the full Terms and Conditions of service.</p>

    <p>Each person working with Umbrella Analytics will need a separate account. You are responsible for keeping your password secret and secure - it is the key to your account and hence to the content you are working on.</p>

    <p>A user who administers an account is responsible for maintaining the security of that account.</p>

    <p>We aim to make the service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. If we do have to plan any down time, we will aim to let you know at least 24 hours in advance and will keep such down time to the weekend where possible.</p>

    <p>We are continually working to improve the service, which means that things will change occasionally. We will let you know via email of any new features or changes to existing features.</p>

    <h3>4. Customer responsibilities</h3>

    <p>You are responsible for the security of your account details, and hence for any activity that occurs via that account. If you become aware that your account may have been compromised, you must let us know immediately and take steps to resecure the account by changing your password.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for making sure that you have the right to share anything you upload to our site. Umbrella Analytics is not meant to be, and will not be allowed to become, a means to share copyrighted materials without the permission of the copyright holder.</p>

    <p>You must not use Umbrella Analytics to engage in any illegal or fraudulent activity. For example, you may not upload any materials that breach laws about child protection, libel or privacy. You must not use our service to send messages to other users in violation of laws about unsolicited email or harassment.</p>

    <p>You must not interfere with the normal operation of the system, nor with any other user's work on the system. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the system or to related systems or networks.</p>

    <h3>5. IP and confidentiality</h3>

    <p>What is ours is ours, and what is yours is yours - this is the key principle we use. However, in order to provide the service, we need certain rights to the content you upload, and you need certain rights to the service itself.</p>

    <p>By creating and using an account on our system, you grant us the rights we need to deliver the service to you. As long as you maintain an account with full and correct details, and pay any invoices that are due, we grant you the rights needed to use the system.</p>

    <p>You may share confidential information with us in the course of using the service. We will not share this with a third party without permission from you - either express or implied (for example, if a user is invited to a project, the content within that project will be shared with them by virtue of that invitation). You are responsible for ensuring that other users invited to share your content treat it with confidentiality and respect.</p>

    <p>We may use your company name and/or logo on our website or other marketing materials unless you ask us not to. We will not imply that you endorse or recommend us unless we have your explicit permission to do so.</p>

    <h3>6. Security and data protection</h3>

    <p>We will take appropriate technical and organisational steps to make sure that your content is protected against unauthorised or accidental access, modification or destruction.</p>

    <p>We are not, however, liable for any losses that you incur as a result of unauthorised access to the system unless such access was the result of our negligence or wilful misconduct.</p>

    <p>We will process your personal data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and only to the extent required to deliver the service (see our separate <a href="{{ site.url }}/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>). We will delete all personal information within a reasonable time of its no longer being needed to deliver the service.</p>

    <h3>7. Suspension and termination</h3>

    <p>If you want to stop using Umbrella Analytics, you must <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact-us.html">notify us by email</a>. Any invoice that would normally be issued during the 14 days following such notice must be paid as usual. Your subscription will end at the end of the period covered by your final invoice. After this, you and your team can continue to access your existing proofs but will not be able to upload any new proofs.</p>

    <p>We may suspend your account temporarily if there is a risk to anyone (including you) affecting the availability of the service or the security of data stored in our system. If we have to suspend your account, we will communicate with you quickly to sort out the problem and get you working again as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>Either of us may terminate our agreement immediately if the other breaches the terms and conditions or becomes insolvent. We may suspend access or terminate your account immediately if required to do so by law-enforcement, regulatory or governmental authority.</p>

    <p>If your account is suspended or terminated, we will not be liable for any losses you incur as a result.</p>
