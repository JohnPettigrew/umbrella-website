    <h2 class="fw-bold">We are a social-positive business</h2>
    <h3>We work for society</h3>
    <p>SOME TEXT ABOUT OUR SOCIAL PURPOSE AND ACTIVITIES</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WHAT CHARITIES DO WE SUPPORT?</li>
      <li>WHAT NETWORKS DO WE ENABLE WITH FREE STUFF?</li>
      <li>ANYTHING ELSE?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>We are build for good</h3>
    <p>STUFF ABOUT HOW WE'RE SET UP AND INCORPORATED</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
        <h3>We are climate positive</h3>
        <p>'Climate positive' means more than planting trees. Umbrella doesn't just plant trees to offset our carbon use (although we do do that). We make policy and practice to actively reduce our carbon output. That means direct impact like server costs, but also office heating, staff travel and more.</p>
        <p>Umbrella is about the future - the future of your business but also the future of the world we live in. There can be no doubt that we are in the middle of a climate emergency, driven by human actions and shortsightedness, that will endanger everyone individually, our society and our very survival.</p>
        <p>Running our business in a way that respects and sustains the planet just makes sense. So, we've made a commitment to sustainability in everything we do across the organisation. We look at Scope 1 emissions (those that arise directly from our activity),  Scope 2 emissions (those that arise from energy we buy) <em>and</em> Scope 3 emissions (everything else we do - business travel, employee commuting, goods and services we buy, and more).</p>
        <p>Taking the climate seriously also means making a financial investment in dealing with the harm we've done to the environment. So, in 2021, we started to work with <a href="https://ecologi.com/" target="_blank">Ecologi</a> to reduce and offset our carbon emissions. We now invest money every month in planting trees to restore lost ecosystems, in carbon offsetting to eliminate the damage our activities do to the environment, and social projects that help build low-carbon systems. We also help and encourage our team to make better choices for their own lives, from travel to food to accommodation.</p>

    <h2>The Cambridge Climate Change Charter</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <p class="col-12 col-md-8">We're fortunate to have an office in Cambridge, where there's help and support available. For example, we've signed the <a href="https://cambridgecarbonfootprint.org/charter/">Cambridge Climate Change Charter</a>, committing ourselves publicly to being part of the solution to the climate emergency. If you're in the Cambridge area (either as in individual or an organisation), you can sign the Charter yourself. Or there may be something similar in your area.</p>
