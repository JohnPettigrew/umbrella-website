        <p>'Climate-positive' means more than planting trees. Umbrella doesn't just offset our carbon usage, we actively reduce it. We don't just look at direct impact like server costs, but also office heating, staff travel and more.</p>
        <p>Umbrella is about the future - the future of your business but also the future of the world we live in. There can be no doubt that we are in the middle of a climate emergency, driven by human actions and shortsightedness, that will endanger our society, our economy and our very survival.</p>
        <p>Running our business in a way that respects and sustains the planet just makes sense. So, we've made a commitment to sustainability in everything we do across the organisation. This means not only Scope 1 emissions (those that arise directly from our activity), not only Scope 2 emissions (those that arise from energy we buy) but also Scope 3 emissions (everything else we do - business travel, employee commuting, goods and services we buy, and more).</p>
        <p>This means running our business, top to bottom, in a climate-positive way. It means looking at the choices we make (power for our servers, travel for our team, heating for our offices) and, one step at a time, making choices that are better for the climate.</p>
        <p>This also means making a financial investment in dealing with the harm we've done to the environment. So, in 2021, we started to work with <a href="https://ecologi.com/" target="_blank">Ecologi</a> to reduce and offset our carbon emissions. As a result, Umbrella is climate-positive back to 2019, and we now invest money every month in planting trees to restore lost ecosystems and in carbon offsetting to eliminate the damage our activities do to the environment. We also help and encourage our team to make better choices for their own lives, from travel to food to accommodation.</p>

      <p class="col-12 col-md-8">We're fortunate to have an office in Cambridge, where there's help and support available. For example, we've signed the <a href="https://cambridgecarbonfootprint.org/charter/">Cambridge Climate Change Charter</a>, committing ourselves publicly to being part of the solution to the climate emergency. If you're in the Cambridge area (either as in individual or an organisation), you can sign the Charter yourself. Or there may be something similar in your area.</p>

        <p>Over and above our commitments in the Cambridge Climate Charter to reporting and reducing our carbon usage as a business, we have set ourselves the following specific goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to run all our servers on renewable electricity;</li>
          <li>to become a fully climate-positive business across all our activities;</li>
          <li>to support our team's return to the office from Winter 2021 with climate-positive commuting;</li>
          <li class="item-complete">to support our team in eating a diet lower in animal products in 2021.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you'd like to find out more about how we're building a climate-positive business, please do ask. There are lots of tools to calculate your business's carbon footprint. The one we used was from our friends at <a href="https://netcarbonnegative.co.uk/" target="_blank">Net Carbon Negative</a>, produced by the digital agency MMT from their own journey to being carbon negative. You can take a look at our climate dashboard at <a href="https://ecologi.com/">Ecologi</a>.
