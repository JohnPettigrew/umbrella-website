    <h2>Additional packs</h2>
    <h3>Implementation pack</h3>
    <p>We work with each business to implement Umbrella in the way that's right for them. All new customers must pay an implementation fee equal to 3 months' subscription, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the creation of 3 dashboards for data visualisation;</li>
      <li>the creation of 3 reports for different senior management needs;</li>
      <li>advice on data cleaning and generation;</li>
      <li>initial kick-off meeting (by video);</li>
      <li>introduction session with the team (by video);</li>
      <li>hands-on training session with the team (by video).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on your requirements, the implementation fee may be higher than this to include options like additional dashboards and reports, custom training, and consultancy. For this work, we charge our standard custom development or consultancy rates <sup><i class="bi-diamond"></i></sup>, as appropriate.</p>
    <h3>Training pack</h3>
    <p>The training included in the Implementation Phase is enough for most teams, especially when combined with our help documentation and live support. However, if you need customised training, we can provide this private online sessions for £100 per hour. If you want us to generate a customised course around Umbrella, possibly including generalised help and support around diversity awareness, we will provide a custom quote once we know your specific needs.</p>

              <p>To gain access to the Umbrella platform beyond the free options outlined at the top of the page, your organisation needs an active subscription. Subscriptions are based on the number of people in the organisation, and can be paid monthly or annually.</p>
              <p>There are two different product strands within Umbrella: <strong>Visualise</strong> and <strong>Analyse</strong>. <strong>Visualise</strong> is all about taking your organisation's data and helping you understand your team better, through the use of charts showing how gender, ethnicity and pay (among other factors) affect each other and so where your organisation might be discriminating and need practical measures to improve. <strong>Analyse</strong> is about taking your organisation's communications and helping you understand how to reach more people, more easily and more effectively, through the use of language analysis tools that highlight where job adverts, policies etc. may unintentionally exclude people, and helping you write better, more inclusive documents.</p>

              <p>We strongly recommend that all software deployments include an appropriate emphasis on training the teams beforehand. Although Umbrella is designed to be easy to use, all change needs suitable support and guidance.
