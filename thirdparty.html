    <h2>List of third-party software used by Umbrella</h2>
    <p>In common with many other modern web apps, we use common libraries and tools as part of our service. Most web applications, including ours, would not be possible the help that these other projects have given the development community. The fact that they do so for free and openly is worthy of much praise, and we're extremely grateful for the path that has been opened for us by the developers of these fantastic projects. The list below isn't exhaustive (modern web applications have a very long list of 'dependencies', which means that each package you use may bring with it quite a few others) but does include the key projects that we rely on.</p>
