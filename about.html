    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>Our founder, Nancy Roberts, has worked in large companies, small companies and academia. In all these environments, she was frustrated by the biases and prejudice she saw towards both herself and others around her. She wanted to see change, and believes passionately that meaningful change is possible. Yet achieving true inclusion, representation and liberation in the workplace requires something more audacious than disjointed individual interventions. As a self-confessed data nerd, Nancy wanted to see organisations using data and evidence to understand themselves and their teams, and to commit to doing better. So, in 2018, she founded Umbrella as an organisation devoted to building a world of justice and equality using hard data and empirical evidence. </p>
    <p>In 2019, John Pettigrew joined the team as co-founder and Chief Product Officer, with the aim of building software that could help all businesses to use the skills and experience Nancy had built up, and so to help more and more businesses to build that better world. Our unique software platform supports employers in addressing bias and creating fairer, more equitable workplaces for employees, ensuring everyone’s place in a fairer future.</p>

            <p>Issues of identity and representation can be highly emotive, so it's vital to face challenges with a level head. Others may rely on unproven methodology and subjective approaches, but we use hard data and empirical evidence to inform the strategies that we propose, delivering actionable insights and measurable change in diversity, representation, equality and, ultimately, liberation.</p>

            <p>Our working lives are affected by hidden biases and prejudices – our own, those of others and those built into the environments we occupy. Using data to discover these biases and their effects means we can help organisations to identify injustice. This knowledge unlocks the door to positive systemic change, so that organisations can build fairer, more productive and more powerful teams.</p>

            <p>Progress is stifled when power and privilege are exercised behind closed doors. We believe employers must find the courage to champion greater transparency, and so create the conditions for their people to thrive. Employees need to feel protected and valued before they can openly challenge discrimination. At Umbrella, we practice what we preach, leading by example in everything we do.</p>
