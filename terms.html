      <li>You become a User who is entitled to access the Service by registering an account. The registration of an account confirms acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
      </li>
      <li>Each User must create a secure password. The User has full responsibility for keeping their chosen password secret and secure.
      </li>
      <li>An Organisation Account must be created within the Service in order to upload and share content.

      </li>
      <li>Administrator(s) have full responsibility for ensuring that anyone accessing their uploaded content will observe these Terms and Conditions, and will indemnify the Company in respect of any loss that arises as a result of permitting such access.
      </li>
      <li>The Company may provide the Customer with documentation, training and email, live-chat and phone support to assist them in their use of the Service, depending on the payment plan adopted by the Customer.
      </li>
      <li>If the Customer requires additional support such as on-site visits the Company shall be entitled to make an additional charge for this Service. The amount of the charge will be agreed with the Customer before any such additional support is delivered.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="numbered-list">Service availability</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>On occasions, down time of the Service will be necessary for essential maintenance or upgrade purposes. The Company will endeavour to provide 24 hours’ notice of the down time and to ensure that the down time is when the Service is least utilised by Customers.
      </li>
      <li>The Company shall not be responsible to the Customer for any delay or failure in carrying out obligations under these Terms and Conditions if the delay or failure is caused by an Event of Force Majeure. The Company shall notify the Customer of any such circumstances as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li>Overall service availability for the Customer may be subject to limits on file sizes, total storage space, number of API calls or otherwise. In the event of a limit applying the Customer will be informed in advance of the limit by the Company.

    </ol>

    <h3 class="numbered-list">Fees and payments</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The Customer will pay the associated fees for use of the Umbrella Analytics platform under any and all Organisation Accounts for which their Users are Administrators.
      </li>
      <li>Available payment plans will be listed on the Company’s website or otherwise communicated to the Customer. Pricing is subject to review. If the Company changes the offered payment plans, existing Customers will be notified within 7 days. Such changes will be immediately binding on new Customers, but existing Customers will have 60 days from the date of notification to choose a new plan or to terminate their use of the Service. At the end of those 60 days, if a Customer has expressed no preference for a new plan, the Company may at its discretion move that Customer to the closest equivalent plan (in the Company’s opinion).
      </li>
      <li>The Customer will continue to be liable for the Fees in accordance with the advertised pricing of the Company for 30 days following such notification. For avoidance of doubt, if an invoice would normally be issued within the 30-day notice period, that invoice will be sent and must be paid.
      </li>
      <li>The Customer’s subscription will end at the close of the period covered by their final invoice.
      </li>
      <li>If a Customer ends a subscription and then takes out a new subscription within 3 months, they will be treated as having a continuous subscription for the whole period, and outstanding fees will be charged for the intervening period between the end of the old subscription and the start of the new subscription. Such fees will be the higher of the two subscription rates, if there is a difference.
      </li>
      <li>The Company will issue invoices (including VAT where appropriate) when a Customer is liable for fees. All payments must be received within 30 days of an invoice being issued.
      </li>
      <li>Charges shall be issued in pounds sterling and shall be payable in pounds sterling within 30 days. The Company may, at its sole discretion, allow payments to be made in different currencies, and may charge additional administration fees for such payments.
      </li>
      <li>The Company may accept payment from Customers via a range of channels, and may at its discretion include additional administration fees for certain channels.
      </li>
      <li>Organisations must provide complete, accurate and up-to-date payment information for their account.
      </li>
      <li>Interest on late payments shall be charged at 3% above the Bank of England’s base rate at the time.
      </li>
      <li>Invoices remain payable in the event of a query on the invoice. Any queries on an invoice rendered must be made within 30 days of receipt. The Company will investigate any such query and respond within 14 days. If a Customer's query is upheld, an adjustment will be made to a subsequent invoice.
      </li>
      <li>The Company reserves the right to suspend or limit access to the Service if the Customer fails to make payment within the requirements of these Terms and Conditions. In particular, a Customer may have their ability to upload data suspended until payment is made.
