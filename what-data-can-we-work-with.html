    <h2 class="text-center">What data can Umbrella work with?</h2>
    <p class="text-center">The Umbrella application can help you clearly see what the data your organisation holds about your people. But what sorts of data can you use for visualisations?</p>
    <div class="row">
      <h3 class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-left text-sm-right">Financial</h3>
      <p class="col-12 col-sm-8">Salary or pay is a crucial factor in helping see whether you are treating your people fairly. It’s the main reason most people have a job, after all, and also the main way that an organisation shows how much it values each person it employs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h3 class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-left text-sm-right">Organisational</h3>
      <p class="col-12 col-sm-8">People can be organised in different ways by a business. There might be different pay bands, different job levels, different business units and so on. Umbrella lets you include an organisational-group column in your data so that you can see if it affects how people are treated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h3 class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-left text-sm-right">Gender</h3>
      <div class="col-12 col-sm-8">
        <p>A key concern for many people is that people are treated fairly regardless of their gender - women, men, non-binary, cis, trans. Umbrella allows you to capture all these gender identities and more, and to see how pay and other factors vary based on them.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <h3 class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-left text-sm-right">Ethnicity</h3>
      <div class="col-12 col-sm-8">
        <p>The past few years have made everyone more aware of how someone’s ethnicity can affect how they’re treated at work and more generally in society. Umbrella lets you group your people according to a wide range of standard ethnic groups and to see how these identities affect how they are treated in your organisation.</p>

      <h3 class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-left text-sm-right">Sexuality</h3>
      <div class="col-12 col-sm-8">
        <p>People may be treated differently within an organisation based on their sexuality, whether they are out at work or not. Umbrella helps you to see how people with different sexuality identities are treated within your organisation.</p>

      <h3 class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-left text-sm-right">Country</h3>
      <p class="col-12 col-sm-8">Whether it's country of origin or the country within which they work, this factor can make a big difference to how people are treated within an organisation. Umbrella helps you see whether people in different countries are treated fairly within your organisation.</p>
