    <h2>Cookie policy</h2>

    <p>This web page sets out how Umbrella Analytics Ltd (which owns and operates the Umbrella Analytics service) uses cookies.</p>
    <p>We ask you to consent to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy when you first register with the Umbrella Analytics service. By continuing to use the service, you consent to this use of cookies.</p>
    <p>For more information about how we handle your personal information, please see our separate <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>Umbrella Analytics Ltd may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy was last updated on <strong>8 July 2019</strong>.</p>

    <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a file stored on your computer by your web browser when requested to do so by a web server. This may contain a unique identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that allows our servers to identify you and hence provide an individualised service.</p>
    <p>Cookies may be used to identify and track users as they navigate a website (giving the provider useful information about features that the users value or have problems with) and also to identify users returning to a website (avoiding the need to log in every time you visit).
    <p>We may also store information in your browser using the local storage facility it provides. This information is used in the same way as cookies and is covered by this policy. All references to cookies from this point on should be read as including all information stored in your browser about you, by whatever means.</p>

    <h3>What cookies do you use?</h3>
    <p>We use cookies and other local storage in your browser to identify you when you visit and ensure that logged-in users receive the appropriate content, and to track your navigation of our website.</p>
    <p>Here is a specific list of what we store in your browser.</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><em>_umbrella_session</em> â€“ we use this to store your current login session with our application. This enables you to continue where you left off without logging in again every time you visit the site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What third-party cookies do you use?</h3>
    <p>We do not use any third-party cookies that may be present on your computer.</p>

    <h3>Cookies and personal information</h3>
    <p>Cookies do not themselves contain personally identifiable information. However, we may link personal information that we store about you to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
    <p>We maintain a separate <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> that sets out how we collect and handle your personal information.</p>

    <h3>How do I block cookies?</h3>
    <p>You can configure most browsers not to accept cookies. However, the <em>Umbrella</em> service (along with many other website) will not work properly if you do choose to block cookies.</p>
    <p>Here are instructions on how to stop some common browsers from accepting cookies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Chrome</em> &ndash; choose Settings from the menu, click Show Advanced Settings... and then click the 'Content Settings...' button under the Privacy heading. The top section of the dialog box that is shown controls cookies, so select 'Block sites from setting any data'.</li>
      <li><em>Firefox</em> &ndash; open your settings (called Options in Windows) and choose the Privacy section. Choose 'Use custom settings for History' from the dropdown menu in the History section and deselect the 'Accept cookies from sites' checkbox.</li>
      <li><em>Safari</em> &ndash; choose Settings and then click the Privacy section. For 'Block cookies and other website data', choose 'Always'.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I delete cookies?</h3>
    <p>Just as for blocking cookies, most browsers let you delete the cookies that have already been stored.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Chrome</em> &ndash; choose Settings from the menu, click Show Advanced Settings... and then click the 'Clear browsing data...' button under the Privacy heading. Select the checkbox labelled 'Delete cookies and other site and plug-in data' and then click Clear Browsing Data.</li>
      <li><em>Firefox</em> &ndash; open your settings (called Options in Windows) and choose the Privacy section. Choose 'Use custom settings for History' from the dropdown menu in the History section and click Show Cookies. Click Remove All Cookies.
      </li>
      <li><em>Safari</em> &ndash; choose Settings and then click the Privacy section. Click 'Remove all Website Data...'.</li>
    </ul>
