Like many of you, my world has changed massively in the past few weeks, and I’m adjusting, as we all are. I wanted to spend a few minutes just sharing what the impact of COVID19 has been on me, on my business, and on my life. I generally don’t write about my personal situation, and I usually spend time editing my posts, but this one is too raw for me to re-read, and I just need to write it and post it, so please forgive any typos and ramblings….

At the beginning of March, having spent two years building Umbrella, I had a healthy order book and was on track to hit my budget for Q1. As the situation progressed, however, I slowly watched my orders disappear: first to go was face-to-face training and consultancy. Next, customers using our job advert analytics stopped recruiting, and put their subscriptions to our job ad optimization tool on hold. The final blow came when the UK Government suspended the requirement to report Gender Pay figures for 2020, meaning our newly-launched online reporting tool was no longer needed by customers. I now face an empty order book with no idea when it might start to be refilled, while the ongoing costs of the business continue to have to be paid. Even if things do turn around, it is a real question as to whether the business can survive that long, given that as a tech startup we don’t qualify for any business support, and are being told we don’t meet the criteria even for the CBILS loans.

On a personal level, too, things have been scarily hard. Technically I am the only payroll employee of my business, and I can’t furlough myself without totally closing the company down; neither can I afford to keep paying myself if I want to prop the business up. For the past two years, the majority of my income has come from self-employment, and my husband is also self-employed. When lockdown hit in the UK, both of us found all our income for the next few months suddenly swept away. We applied for Universal Credit, but were refused because we rent out a property (even though this only ever breaks even, with the rent covering the mortgage leaving little to no profit, and at present we are of course concerned for our tenants and looking at offering rent reductions or holidays to help them out). From the start of March, then, the only real income we have had is a few small payments for some freelance work, and even if we qualify for the Government self-employed payment (and it’s still not clear if we will) that money will not be paid until the end of June, which feels a long way off right now.

In my brighter moments, I know my situation could be a lot worse. We are safe, we have a home, we are both (so far) healthy and able to shop for ourselves, take daily walks in the sun, and generally look after each other. But we have seen our professional lives ripped out from under us, and I’m not going to lie, emotionally it’s been hard. I now recognize that I have been grieving, in the truest sense, for the potential demise of a business that I have worked on 60 hours a week, 52 weeks a year for nearly 2 years.

I don’t intend to be beaten, but some days getting out of bed and showering feels like I have conquered Everest. This week, I have come to some acceptance of the situation and am trying to move forward; this is why I have set up a Patreon page to see if that is a way I can raise enough money to pay my bills for the next couple of months.

I have also signed up to be an NHS volunteer, and am doing pro bono data analytics for some fellow Tech for Good businesses who are overwhelmed with work at present. I’m also looking at how we can use our platform to help businesses track the impacts of the crisis on their staff, which we will endeavour to offer for free.

If you asked my friends and family to define me in one word, they would most likely all say “independent.” It’s not in my nature to ask for help, but this is not a normal world, and I am asking now. If you are able to, please sign up to my Patreon and help me to weather this storm. I can’t express how much that would mean to me. In the meantime, I hope you and your families are safe, healthy and protected, and that we can all weather this storm together.

Stay safe
