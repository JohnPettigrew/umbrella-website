title:  "Remote working: the enemy of inclusion?"

Social distancing and self-isolation feel like the natural enemies of workplace inclusion. At Umbrella, we are generally strong advocates of flexible and remote working as they are proven to help increase diversity and inclusion. However, we also know that to work remotely successfully requires thought, intention and careful management. With many companies now being forced to implement remote working policies with little time to plan, there may be an increased risk of exclusion for already vulnerable groups; home is not always a place of safety and comfort and for many workers, going into an office may be a welcome release.

As leaders, we cannot assume that all our staff have a safe and comfortable home environment in which to work. Remote working may present particularly challenges to certain vulnerable groups.

-          [1 in 8 people in the UK are carers](https://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/press-releases/facts-and-figures) who will need to balance work with their domestic responsibilities
-          There are an estimated 8 million people who live alone in the UK for whom social distancing may mean no face to face contact at all; and we know there is a correlation [between living alone and mental illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6493731/)

-          During tough times we know that domestic violence is likely to increase; [events in China have borne this out](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/coronavirus-quarantine-lockdown-domestic-violence-boris-johnson) and we can expect to see the same results here.
-          An estimated 1.5 million adults in the UK [do not have access to a bank account](https://www.choose.co.uk/guide/financial-exclusion-causes.html). For these people, not being able to receive cash in hand could have immediate consequences

We believe that this crisis can prove a test case for companies on how effectively they can manage remote working across the organization, and some good may come out of this if, when the current crisis has passed, companies are able to expand their flexible working offer. However, we know the pressures that HR teams are currently under to transition workforces to remote working, and that companies do not have the luxury of time to build plans and ensure trust is created and sustained during this period.

With this in mind, we have mobilized our collective brains and created some tools to help identify where the biggest challenges are, to enable HR and Business Continuity teams to “triage” requests for help and ensure that support goes most quickly to those most in need.

Currently we have two products almost ready to release:

-          A simple survey app to allow organizations to assess the practicalities of working from home for staff and identify areas where practical support may be needed
-          An ongoing pulse survey app, exploring whether staff working remotely feel included and supported

We believe these simple tools will help HR teams to stay vigilant regarding any particularly vulnerable staff members, and also to ensure that actions can be swiftly taken to help staff work effectively and productively from home.

Necessity is the mother of invention, and we hope by quickly developing these tools we can support companies in ensuring all staff feel included, even during these unprecedented times.

We would love to offer this support to companies most in need, and will therefore try our best to offer them for free to any non-profits and public sector bodies who get in touch with us. If you’re a corporate who can pay for these services, you can enable us to support more of these companies who may not have your resources. And if you already have resources in place and do not need these services, please consider donating so we can offer help to more under-pressure frontline services in their time of need.
