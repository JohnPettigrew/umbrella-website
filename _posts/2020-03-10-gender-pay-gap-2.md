Since the publication of the first set of Gender Pay Data in 2018 we at Umbrella have been tracking the metatrends in the data. One of the things we find most interesting is looking at the shape of the pipeline across all the datasets.

What is striking is that, between the first and second datasets, although the mean pay gap fell by around half a percent, the shape of the pipeline hardly shifted at all. The chart below shows the two years in comparison and as you can see the only real change is a 1% shift in female representation from the Upper Middle quartile to the Upper Quartile. At the lower end of the pay scale there is no movement at all, with women continuing to be over-represented in the lowest paying roles.

As an employer, you should be comparing your individual pipeline over the past two years with where is stands now before you start setting targets for board representation. You need to be thinking about how to move women up the pay scale starting at the bottom, and looking at the progress you have made over 3 years will give you a sense of how quickly you can expect these changes to reach the top.

Comparing yourself to the larger dataset can be a useful way of seeing if you are facing particular challenges or if the progress you are making is roughly in line with the general trends. Which isn’t to say that if it is, you are doing enough! The Fawcett Society estimates that at current progress the gap won’t close for another 60 years, and although amongst the under 40s the gap is close to zero, there is a worrying gap appearing in apprenticeship pay, with female apprentices earning on average £2000 less than male, suggesting that the current pay parity in the lowest quartile may be fragile….

Closing the pay gap requires concerted efforts on a number of fronts, and although getting more women into leadership is definitely a worthy goal we should not neglect the gaps which exist in the lowest paying roles. Looking holistically at your pipeline is a great way to make sure that you are not fixing a problem in one area just to have another one arise somewhere else.
