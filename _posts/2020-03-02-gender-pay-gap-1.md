As we approach the 2020 Gender Pay Gap reporting deadline, many employers are now looking at three years’ worth of data and wondering why the gap is proving so hard to close. If this is you, we are aiming to help you better understand your data with this short series of posts.

In this blog we are looking at the difference between the mean and the median. The main question you need to ask is which of these metrics is more meaningful for your organization? The government mandates that you produce both, but to really understand what’s going on in your business you need to decide which one is more useful for you to focus on, and why they may differ.

Means are generally better understood, as they represent what most of us would typically refer to as an “average”. For this reason they appear to be much more quoted in discussions of the gender pay gap than medians. But there’s a problem with this. Means are very easily skewed by outliers, so if you have one or two people in your business who are extremely highly paid compared to the majority, your mean salary will be skewed upwards by these extreme cases.

If you do use the mean, then, it is important to also understand the standard deviation of your dataset. The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of your dataset, which will help you to understand if you have outliers which may be skewing your result. A low standard deviation means your datapoints are all clustered relatively near to the mean; a high standard deviation means there is a wide spread of datapoints, on other words you may well have outliers.

You can calculate the standard deviation in excel ([see here](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/stdev-function-51fecaaa-231e-4bbb-9230-33650a72c9b0) to learn how). If your standard deviation has increased on last year, the range of salaries that exist across your business is getting wider and this may be exacerbating the problem.

If you have a dataset with outliers, the median may well prove a more useful statistic to measure as it is much more resistant to distortion and can be viewed as representing a more “usual” number in your dataset, in that it is the salary of the person who falls exactly in the middle when all employees are lined up in salary order.

But whichever you use (and we think you need to be looking hard at both!) you need to understand the consequences of it and ensure that this is informing your actions to close the gap. You could easily find that a lot of hard work in standardizing salaries for low-paid staff can be undone by one well paid senior hire….
