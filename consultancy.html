    <h2 class="fw-bold"><span>Consultancy:</span> when you need help, not just a platform</h2>
    <p>Our purpose at Umbrella Analytics is to give you the tools to build a more inclusive business. Our team <a href="/pricing.html#consultancy">can provide consultancy</a> around your use of our platform and how it can fit into your business. But we know that, sometimes, you need more than this. Whether it's independent advice, expert intervention, an experienced trainer or something else, you may find you need to engage a consultant to help you make the progress you want.</p>
    <p>Umbrella Analytics itself was born from our CEO's experiences as a consultant, so we know the power a good person can bring to your work of inclusion, equity and representation. We're therefore building a network of consultants who can help your business alongside the Umbrella platform. The people listed below are independent consultants, but have two key things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>skills that can help you along your journey to improve inclusion; and</li>
      <li>experience with the Umbrella platform and how data and analysis can help build diversity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can approach any of these consultants secure in the knowledge that they will know what they're about, and will work with your investment in Umbrella and not around or against it.</p>
    <p>We get no commission or kickbacks from these consultants. The listings are based on their demonstrated skills working in the field of equity, diversity and inclusion, and on their experience working with the Umbrella platform.</p>
